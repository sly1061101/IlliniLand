CS233 is already going horribly? I took the first 233 quiz and got a 60 on the short part and a 50 on the verilog. I thought that it wouldn't be too bad but then I realized that the quiz is 10% of the final grade! WTF, now even if I second chance and get 100 on everything else in this class I can no longer get an A.
What's the difference between math415 and math416 I was confused the difference between math415 and math416, will math415 eaiser than math416 but more workload?
What if question has huanhang? just like this  hahahah wandanleba
